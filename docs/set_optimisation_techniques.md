# SET-driven Optimisation Techniques

After a complete SET analysis, several techniques can be used to optimise the circuit sensisitivity to the SETs. A brief description of each technique is presented in the following sections. 

## Pin Assignment / Rewiring

Pin assingment / rewiring is a technique used in logic synthesis to improve the circuit power and performance by taking advantage of the functional equivalence of input pins of logic gates. For example, for a NAND gate, as shown in the next [figure](), the output evaluates to logic-1 whenever one of its inputs is in logic-0, regardless of the input pin (A or B).
