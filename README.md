# UPSET
UPSET is a Single Event Transient (SET) Analysis tool supporting both SET Generation and Propagation for whole circuits, based on Static Timing Analysis (STA). STA emulated signal propagation, from all timing path start points, through combinational logic to circuit endpoints, by propagating both rise/fall delays and slews and supports both the standard NLDM (Non-Linear Delay Model), as well as the more advanced CCS (Composite Current Source) timing model. By utilising CASlab's STA engine for SET generation and propagation, UPSET is able to model transient faults, originated by particles strikes, (i) with _acceptable loss of accuracy over SPICE_, and (ii) using static analysis over simulation, resulting in _many orders of magnitude speedup_.
